  abstract = "BACKGROUND: To provide the validated and standardized form of the
              Persian version of the Ages and Stages Questionnaires as an
              appropriate developmental screening tool for evaluation of
              Iranian children's development. METHODS: This was a
              cross-sectional study. Translation and back-translation, content
              validity determination, cultural and lingual modifications, pilot
              study on 100 parents and inter-rater reliability determinations
              were performed, respectively. The national and final stage was
              carried out 11000, 4-60 month-old children in selected cities
              throughout the country in order to determine the validity,
              standard deviation, reliability, sensitivity, specificity, and
              mean scores points of the test. RESULTS: The reliability,
              determined by cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.76 to 0.86 and the
              inter-rater reliability was 0.93. The validity determined by
              factor analysis was satisfactory. The mean scores of Iranian
              children were identified and compared with those of the normative
              sample as well as with three other populations of children. The
              developmental status of Iranian children was higher in the
              communication, problem-solving and personal-social domains,
              especially under the age of 24 months, after which their
              developmental status seems to deteriorate, especially in the
              motor domains. CONCLUSION: The Persian version of the ASQ has
              appropriate validity and reliability for screening developmental
              disorders in Iran.",

              disabilities, by urbanicity: United States, 2015-2018",
  author   = "Zablotsky, Benjamin and Black, Lindsey I",
  abstract = "Objective-This report examines the prevalence of developmental
              disabilities among children in both rural and urban areas as well
              as service utilization among children with developmental issues
              in both areas. Methods-Data from the 2015-2018 National Health
              Interview Survey (NHIS) were used to examine the prevalence of 10
              parent- or guardian-reported developmental disability diagnoses
              (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], autism spectrum
              disorder, blindness, cerebral palsy, moderate to profound hearing
              loss, learning disability, intellectual disability, seizures,
              stuttering or stammering, and other developmental delays) and
              service utilization for their child. Prevalence estimates are
              presented by urbanicity of residence (urban or rural). Bivariate
              logistic regressions were used to test for differences by
              urbanicity. Results-Children living in rural areas were more
              likely to be diagnosed with a developmental disability than
              children living in urban areas (19.8\% compared with 17.4\%).
              Specifically, children living in rural areas were more likely
              than those in urban areas to be diagnosed with ADHD (11.4\%
              compared with 9.2\%) and cerebral palsy (0.5\% compared with
              0.2\%). However, among children with a developmental disability,
              children living in rural areas were significantly less likely to
              have seen a mental health professional, therapist, or had a
              well-child checkup visit in the past year, compared with children
              living in urban areas. Children with a developmental disability
              living in rural areas were also significantly less likely to
              receive Special Educational or Early Intervention Services
              compared with those living in urban areas. Conclusion-Findings
              from this study highlight differences in the prevalence of
              developmental disabilities and use of services related to
              developmental disabilities by rural and urban residence.",
